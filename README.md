## Name
Winning-At-Marketing

## Description
In this project, I cleaned up the HTML codes in the index to more descriptive HTML semantics. I also cleaned up the CSS so that it was less lengthy, easier to read, and matched the index. I used this website: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp for reference. Here's the link to the live server: http://127.0.0.1:5500/01-Week_HTML-Git-CSS/Develop/index.html and link to git hub deployment: https://github.com/AStandish/Winning-at-Marketing.git

## Usage
I first changed the index codes from the last three screenshots (4, 5, 6) to more descriptive HTML codes you see in the index (header, section, aside, and footer). I also switched the CSS around to flow with the index. I added some simple additions to the classes in the index (firstSection, secondSection) and added them to CSS so that the CSS was easier to read as the properties under these sections were the same and made the code less lengthy. 

The first three screenshots (1, 2, 3) are the open with live server visuals of the website working correctly after everything was changed.
